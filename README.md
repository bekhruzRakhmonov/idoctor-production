# iDoctor
It is platform for doctors and their patients. This platform helps them to interact with each others. It has a lot of features like, writing post or article, making appointment with doctor and real time chatting between doctors. And also I am gonna to add new feature which helps doctors to exchange their big data with their colleagues.
